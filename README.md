# Hangman
A small ruby Hangman game

This project was intended to practice trying to open and save files in ruby. I had to open files like the dictionary which held the list of words that could be chosen or the graphical representaions of the tituler hangman. You can also save your game and start your progress where you left off(you know in case you just can't finish a game of hangman). Most of the project went pretty smoothly and making the game itself work was not a problem. Getting the save to work stumped me for a very long time(it was mostly a syntax error on my part. I felt very dumb) but now it works and thats all that matters. Overal this was fun practice on opening files/serialization. It was also cool to make a game with graphics!
